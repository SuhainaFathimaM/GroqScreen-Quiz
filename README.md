## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Weave AI Magic With Groq**

---

## üéØ Objective

GroqScreen Quiz is a creative and interactive multimodal application powered by Groq, leveraging its vision and language capabilities to solve the real-world problem of passive online learning. Our objective is to build a user-friendly tool that allows learners to capture educational content from their screen, instantly receive AI-powered summaries generated by Groq, and engage with automatically created multiple-choice quizzes for effective knowledge reinforcement. By harnessing Groq's ultra-fast inference, we aim to provide a seamless and highly interactive learning experience, fostering deeper understanding and better retention of information.

### Our Approach:
- We chose the "Weave AI Magic With Groq" problem because we recognized the immense potential of Groq's speed and multimodal capabilities to transform how individuals learn online. The challenge of actively engaging with digital educational content and efficiently testing comprehension resonated with our team's desire to build innovative learning tools.
- Key challenges we addressed included capturing screen content effectively, seamlessly integrating Groq's Vision and Language models for both summarization and quiz generation, and designing an intuitive user experience that streamlines the learning process. We focused on crafting precise prompts to guide Groq in generating accurate and relevant summaries and engaging quiz questions directly related to the captured material.
- During the hacking process, we experimented with different approaches for content extraction and prompt engineering. The speed of Groq's API allowed for rapid iteration and refinement of our AI interactions. A key breakthrough was realizing the power of combining Groq's vision analysis with subsequent language processing to create contextually rich summaries and quizzes.

## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- Web browser with JavaScript support.
- Internet connection to access the Groq API and Vercel deployment.
- Groq API Key (set as an environment variable in Vercel).

### Online Access:
The project is deployed online and can be accessed via [https://groq-screen-quiz.vercel.app/](https://groq-screen-quiz.vercel.app/).

### Local Development (If you want to run a local development server):
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/SuhainaFathimaM/GroqScreen-Quiz](https://github.com/SuhainaFathimaM/GroqScreen-Quiz)

# Navigate to the project directory
cd GroqScreenQuiz

# Install frontend dependencies (if any build process is needed)
# npm install
# npm run dev

# Navigate to the backend API directory
cd api
npm install  # Or yarn install

# Set up environment variables (create a .env file in the api directory)
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Run the local backend (for testing purposes - requires Node.js)
node analyze.js
```
Note: For the full Groq-powered experience, deploy the api/analyze.js as a Vercel Serverless Function and configure the GROQ_API_KEY as an environment variable in your Vercel project settings. Ensure your frontend JavaScript in quiz.html is correctly calling the Vercel API endpoint (/api/analyze).
